=== Monday 2022-09-05
*Anish:* Connected the main board if the test robot with motor drivers. Placed everything in the chasis provided. Checked the wire connections. (2h) +   
*Georgs:* Took measurements of the test robot so that the thrower can be made. (2h) +

=== Thursday 2022-09-08
*Anish:* Gone through the schematic to follow for wiring. Prepared the wire accordingly with appropriate conenctors. Connected everything as per the schematic. Tested motors individually, and conenction with the drivers. (1.5h) +  

=== Friday 2022-09-09
*Georgs:* Started designing the test thrower. Had some problems with Fusion360, but figured them out. (5h) +

=== Monday 2022-09-12
*Anish*: Following the completion of software, tested for driving the test robot straight, commands given from the computer manually. Conencted the thrower motor, and tested. Proceded to schematic design for new robot. (2.5h) +   
*Georgs:* Measure the thrower motor dimensions and made a model. Showed the test thrower design to the supervisors. Received some input on what to redesign. (2.5h) +
   
=== Thursday 2022-09-15
*Anish:* Completed the schematic design (apparently). Started the work for pcb design. Changed one of the motors as it turned out to be faulty. tested the new motor, and assembled it in the test robot. (2h) +   

== Sunday 2022-09-18
*Georgs:* Completed the revised thrower design. (4h) +

== Monday 2022-09-19
*Georgs:* Submitted the thrower design for approval, got some feedback that needs to be fixed. (1.5h) +

=== Monday 2022-09-19
*Anish:* PCB dsign continued. Some new footprints made (custom). Progress presentation. (1.5h)+   

=== Thursday 2022-09-22
*Anish:* The omni-motion tested. Got sued to the battery basics, and received teh batetry. Made connectors compliant to the ones with abttery. Rewired the test robot. (2h)+   

=== Monday 2022-09-26
*Anish:* Needed to change the PCB schematic adn design since few components were changed. PCB was too large, needed to make it smaller. (1h)+   

=== Thursday 2022-09-29
*Anish:* PCB design completed. Needed few final tweaks. Sent the design for approval. Assembled the parts of the test robot after changing few parts (motor and driver) (1.5h)+   

=== Monday 2022-10-03

=== Thursday 2022-10-06
*Anish:* With some of the previous issues solved, the PCB design had new issues assigned. Sequentially tried to sort those issues. (1.5h)+

=== Monday 2022-10-10
*Anish:* Still there were issues with the board design. Mainly with the high current paths and differential USB pair routing. Updated the board with hgh current paths with copper fill. Tweaked few other things in the PCB design to make it an optimal design (1.5h)+

=== Monday 2022-10-24
*Anish:* Rewired the cables including the thrower motor in test robot. Checked the connections and if the motors were well connected by powering the robot and driving the motors: wheels and thrower. Continued with the PCB design part. (1.5h)+


=== Thursday 2022-10-27
*Anish:* Pushed the new design to github repo. Got few more issues in the design, and solved them. Repushed the commits. Few issues were remaining. Waiting for the response/approval. (2h) +

=== Monday 2022-10-31
*Anish:* Progress presentation. Started camera calibration. (1.5h)+
*Artem:* Attended progress presentations. (1h)+

=== Thursday 2022-11-3
*Anish:* Some issues related to the realsense library. Solving the issues. Started camera configuration: blod detection and setting optimum parameter values. (2h)+
*Artem:* Received PCB and Start soldering. Work with camera calibration. (1.5h)+ 

=== Monday 2022-11-7
*Anish:* Configured color settings for the realsense and started the ball detection. Lighting and brightness gives problems while ball detection. Reconfigured color settings and parameters. (2.5h)+
*Artem:* Resolve issues with PCB. Running ball detection program. (2h)+

=== Thursday 2022-11-10
*Anish:* Configures the camera in computer lab. Detects the ball. But in other rooms, the ball detection program is irresponsive. Sorting out the problems. (2h)+
*Artem:* Soldering and working with the PCB. Many problems faced in order to sue the new PCBs.(1.5h)+
