=== Monday 2022-09-05
*Anish:* Connected the main board if the test robot with motor drivers. Placed everything in the chasis provided. Checked the wire connections. (2h) +   
*Georgs:* Took measurements of the test robot so that the thrower can be made. (2h) +

=== Thursday 2022-09-08
*Anish:* Gone through the schematic to follow for wiring. Prepared the wire accordingly with appropriate conenctors. Connected everything as per the schematic. Tested motors individually, and conenction with the drivers. (1.5h) +  

=== Friday 2022-09-09
*Georgs:* Started designing the test thrower. Had some problems with Fusion360, but figured them out. (5h) +

=== Monday 2022-09-12
*Anish*: Following the completion of software, tested for driving the test robot straight, commands given from the computer manually. Conencted the thrower motor, and tested. Proceded to schematic design for new robot. (2.5h) +

=== Thursday 2022-09-15
*Anish:* Completed the schematic design (apparently). Started the work for pcb design. Changed one of the motors as it turned out to be faulty. tested the new motor, and assembled it in the test robot. (2h) +   

== Sunday 2022-09-18

=== Monday 2022-09-19
*Anish:* PCB dsign continued. Some new footprints made (custom). Progress presentation. (1.5h)+   

=== Thursday 2022-09-22
*Anish:* The omni-motion tested. Got sued to the battery basics, and received teh batetry. Made connectors compliant to the ones with abttery. Rewired the test robot. (2h)+   

=== Monday 2022-09-26
*Anish:* Needed to change the PCB schematic adn design since few components were changed. PCB was too large, needed to make it smaller. (1h)+   

=== Thursday 2022-09-29
*Anish:* PCB design completed. Needed few final tweaks. Sent the design for approval. Assembled the parts of the test robot after changing few parts (motor and driver) (1.5h)+   

=== Monday 2022-10-03

=== Thursday 2022-10-06
*Anish:* With some of the previous issues solved, the PCB design had new issues assigned. Sequentially tried to sort those issues. (1.5h)+

*Georgs* Thrower design aproved, got acquainted with the CNC mill. Milled out parts for the thrower. (3h)+

=== Monday 2022-10-10
*Anish:* Still there were issues with the board design. Mainly with the high current paths and differential USB pair routing. Updated the board with hgh current paths with copper fill. Tweaked few other things in the PCB design to make it an optimal design (1.5h)+

*Georgs* Assembled the thrower and attached it to the test robot. (2h)+
=== Monday 2022-10-24
*Anish:* Rewired the cables including the thrower motor in test robot. Checked the connections and if the motors were well connected by powering the robot and driving the motors: wheels and thrower. Continued with the PCB design part. (1.5h)+

*Georgs* Started designing the omni-wheels. Goes very slow. (3.5h)+


=== Thursday 2022-10-27
*Anish:* Pushed the new design to github repo. Got few more issues in the design, and solved them. Repushed the commits. Few issues were remaining. Waiting for the response/approval. (2h)+

=== Monday 2022-10-31
*Anish:* Progress presentation. Started camera calibration. (1.5h) +

*Georgs* Progress presentations, wheel design started. (2h) +

*Artem:* Attended progress presentations. (1h) +

=== Thursday 2022-11-3
*Anish:* Some issues related to the realsense library. Solving the issues. Started camera configuration: blod detection and setting optimum parameter values. (2h) +   

*Artem:* Received PCB and Start soldering. Work with camera calibration. (1.5h) +  

=== Monday 2022-11-7
*Anish:* Configured color settings for the realsense and started the ball detection. Lighting and brightness gives problems while ball detection. Reconfigured color settings and parameters. (2.5h) +   

*Georgs* Omniwheel design, took some measurements. Everythings going smoothly. (2h) +

*Artem:* Resolve issues with PCB. Running ball detection program. (2h) +

=== Thursday 2022-11-10
*Anish:* Configures the camera in computer lab. Detects the ball. But in other rooms, the ball detection program is irresponsive. Sorting out the problems. (2h) +   

*Georgs* Printed a test piece for omniwheel design. The rollers fit in great. The design is ready for approval. Submitted for approval. (3h) +

*Artem:* Soldering and working with the PCB. Many problems faced in order to sue the new PCBs.(1.5h) +

=== Monday 2022-11-14
*Anish:* Progress presentation. Tried to reconfigure all the things including the baskets and field. (2h) +

=== Thursday 2022-11-17
*Anish:* Mainboard communication with the software part, communicating over serial. Sending commands for motors turning in various configuration with thrower as well. Configuring various objects like balls, field, baskets, b/w parts and others. Tried to come up with a proper detection algorithm. (3h) +
*Artem:* Testing the mainboard; driving motors (1h) +
*Georgs* Printed out all of the needed omniwheel parts (3h)+

=== Monday 2022-11-21
*Anish:* Programmed for the robot to find the ball and turn where the ball is. Used the linear scaling to map the speed from the distance between the ball and the center of the camera frame. Problems detected with linear scling: not accurat and has issues as ball is pretty far from the robot. Tried further to scale the speed, but failed. (3.5h) +
*Artem:* Soldering the new PCB. Connected few terminals with wire as the MOSFET could not tbe interfaced. (1.5h) +

=== Wednesday 2022-11-23
*Anish:* Programmed the software part for ball detectiona nd follow. Ran into the same problem of not so precise ball tracking. Detects the ball but the tracking algorithm fails. Need to change the scaling factor and might need to incorporate PID control as the movement in left and right motion is not symmetric. Tested the thrower and calibrated the thrower speed according to the distance. interpoaltion yet to be implemented. Here also lienar scaling performed, but not precise. Reconfigured all color confugurations again as theer were few problems while ball detection. (4.5h) +

=== Monday 2022-11-28
*Anish:* Progress presentation.Tuned the proportional tuning for P-controller, scaling the speeds for controlled motion of the robot. Reconfigured colors for better object derection, especially balls. (2.5h)+

=== Thursday 2022-12-02
*Anish:* Tested the ball detection and ball follow. Works good when the ball is near. But when the ball is on the other half of the court, the robot does not detect the ball. Very difficult to tune. Reconfigured colors to detect the ball multiple times. Rand into the same problem. (3h)+

=== Monday 2022-12-5
*Anish:* Continued with ball following. Slight progress in the ball following, but the same problem of not detecting when the ball is farther away. (2h)+

=== Thursday 2022-12-8
*Anish:* Tried implementing the state machine logic and responding to referee commands. (1.5h)+

=== Monday 2022-12-12
